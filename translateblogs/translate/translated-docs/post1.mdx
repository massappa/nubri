# Character Dialogue

Late night atop a cliff, amidst pine trees. Murong Guying leans against an ancient pine, sensing movement.

"Brother Sima, why lurk in shadows?" Murong speaks coldly.

A dark figure emerges silently. Sima Wuhen bows: "Master Murong's keen senses are impressive."

"We both seek martial perfection. No need for empty words." Murong turns, sword energy shimmering.

"The Elder Dugu says your sword path has strayed."

"Hmph, what right has that old hermit to judge me?"

Xuanyuan Lengfeng descends under moonlight: "Brother Murong, you err. Elder Dugu means well. Your sword skill is strong but has lost its true spirit."

"Since you're all here, let's test our skills!"

Battle erupts beneath the moon. Sword lights flash, hidden weapons fly, each warrior displaying their unique mastery and character.
